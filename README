These are my changes to Jim Fox's excellent uwthesis.cls file and accompanying
document source. Now that UW has gone to electronic-only submission, we should
really be using the hyperref package to produce better electronic documents.

Adding this package broke a bunch of things in Jim's version, which I fix here.
